# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-gate are documented here.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **"Why?" justification button**: Gate window now includes a "Why?" button that asks Claude to explain why the intercepted command is needed. Uses session transcript context to provide a concise, plain-text explanation (2-4 sentences). Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. (#15)

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Configurable timeout**: `timeout` and `timeout_action` fields in `[defaults]` section of rules.toml. Visual countdown timer in the gate window changes color as time runs low (orange at 10s, red at 5s). Minimum bounds enforced (5s general, 30s for passthrough auto-approve). (#11)
- **Audit logging**: Every decision (passthrough, deny, gate approve/deny/timeout) is appended to `~/.config/claude-gate/audit.jsonl` with timestamp, session ID, tool name, command, matched rule, and risk level. Thread-safe writes with stderr warnings on failure. (#13, #4)
- **Persistent approval rules**: "Always Allow" and "Always Deny" buttons in the gate window. Creates permanent rules in rules.toml with exact-match patterns. Always Allow requires Touch ID authentication. Rules are inserted at top for first-match-wins priority. (#12)
- **OS notifications**: macOS notification via UserNotifications framework when a gate window appears. Shows rule name, risk level, and command. Clicking the notification brings the gate window to front. (#10)

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- Initial release
- Rule engine with TOML config (first-match-wins evaluation)
- BiometricAuth with Touch ID + password fallback (3 retries, 60s timeout)
- Native macOS gate window (AppKit) with rule info, risk level, agent justification
- Security audit via Anthropic API (Claude Haiku)
- 50+ default rules covering system destruction, git, packages, credentials, network, docker, CI/CD
- Fail-closed security (bad JSON, missing config = deny)
- CI workflow with rule engine tests
- Release workflow for self-hosted macOS builds
